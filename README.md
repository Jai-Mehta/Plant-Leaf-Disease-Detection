## Abstract
Agriculture is a vital source of income for many people around the world. However, plant diseases pose a significant threat to farmers as they can severely impact crop quality and quantity. Detecting and preventing these diseases is crucial to increase productivity. This project focuses on using deep learning and computer vision to automatically detect and recognize plant diseases from images of plant leaves, with a specific focus on tomato and potato leaves.

## Introduction
The agriculture industry plays a critical role in our lives, and any issues affecting plants can lead to significant losses in crop production. Climate change and pollution expose plants to various diseases, resulting in reduced crop yield. This project explores the use of deep learning to detect plant diseases at an early stage, which can contribute to increased crop yield. Traditional methods of disease diagnosis are costly and require expert intervention. Using artificial intelligence and computer vision, we can automatically detect plant diseases from raw leaf images, saving time and resources and reducing the need for harmful chemical pesticides.
